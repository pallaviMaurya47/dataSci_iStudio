EDA => EXPLORATORY data analysis
(data wrangling)

Steps:->
Raw data: have no pattern or feature
  => > DATA EXPLORATORATION 
  => data cleaning ( Duplicate values, missing values: by imputation the cells & delete)
  => Data Preprocessing( making in FORMATE: means like in Series or dataframes)
  => analysis
  =>ML model


DATA EXPLORATORATION: ( 2)
>>High level understanding
  :apply command over whole dataset-- mean,median

>>Low level understanding
  :could be -->univariate- one column
            -->bivariate
            -->multivariate- combintn of columns

Quartiles:->

first Quartile- 25%= 25%(n+1)
50%
75%
IQL-interquartile


Correlation:-> 
          when two sets of data are strongly linked together we say they have a High Correlation.
+ve : when the values increase together and
-ve Correlation: decreases together. 

>>Correlation is assumed to be linear( following a line).
>> 1 :Perfect +ve
0 : no Correlation
