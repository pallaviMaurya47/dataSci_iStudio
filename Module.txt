@1st: Python Programming=>{

    *General Programming language ( another R PROGRMM)
    *High level language
    *ease to develop Prototypes like easy structure & readilibity
    *versatile language - most fields like DA,Data science
    *interpreted language ( HLL to LLL:Machine code), not compiled language
    *casesensitive

>>Basics of Python{
    Keywords=reserverd words

    #Variables==identifiers( words which helps to assign specific meaning to it):- integers: unlimited precision & have octal,biary orhexDec
     
     Float-int+fractional parts
     String: Python has built-in string class( str-immutable)
     Boolean:T/F
     complex numbers: 2+3i
     None DT

     # 4 non-primitives={
        List- mutable, [ ordered collection of heterogenous items with addresses(idx)]
            -dynamic, can add,delete,search,move items
        tuple
        Dict
